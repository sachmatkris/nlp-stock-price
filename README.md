This github repository shows my experiments on combining simple financial sentiment model with other (possibly) relevant data to predict the change in price of a stock. In particular, experiments were ran on DISNEY(DIS), but you can try adjusting the script to your purposes. Playground includes experiments with transformers, logistic regression, other LGBMs using the full data, but since nothing fruitful was achieved I decided to drop the idea of full time series prediction and focused on the days where headline sentiment is recognized and rises above/falls below some thresholds to indicate significant events. This approach yielded positive R2, indicating that market news truly have a predictive signal that could be accounted for in price modeling.
